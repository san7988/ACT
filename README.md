<h3>Abstract To Concrete Test Cases</h3>

This is a project to convert the abstract testcases , as generated after reading the statechart, to concrete testcases.

The first step is to parse the statechart to obtain some suitable intermediate data structure.
For parsing the statechart we are using JLex and CUP. With JLex , we create a lexical analyzer which recursively creates new tokens and passes it to the parser, as generated by CUP. The parser then parses the token using a grammar and creates intermediate GRAPH type data structure.

The intermediate data structure, being a sub type of graph, is fed into the front end system which generates the path predicates.

Neccesary documentation regarding cup and JLex can be found in docs folder.
